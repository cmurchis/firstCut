# firstCut

A booking site for a mobile cosmetologist, specializing in babies first haircut. A momentous experience memorialized by a piece of custom jowelery featuring a lock of babies hair, captured in resin for all time. 

The scheduling feature uses gcal's appointment setting tool. Admin can set their available hours, users selected from those times and submit any custom information via a request form. Approved requests can be tracked and managed with a series of follow up reminders and information gathering, automated emails.

2 modals... one for before and afters and the other displays options for the custom resin jewelery selections.
